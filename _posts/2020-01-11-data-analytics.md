The advancement of IoT industry made the field work of hydrologists not so complicated in the term of sweat labour but processing large amount of data.

The advancement of space technologies also brought us a large amount of data.

*How to deal with them?*

Do it in batch!

Do it in bulk!

Automate the whole processes!

That will leave us to have time to do more meaningful and active works which requires domain knowledge of the field.

- Deriving the meaning of the results
- Identify problems
- Data modelling
- Giving consultation and recommendation based on model.
- Communicate the results with different stakeholders

***

In science, the domain knowledge in each field is extremely important. To me, it is mainly about Water Resources and Earth Observation. They are the keys which I prefer to get more insight about the world and nature around me. Together with ability to cooperate with sustainability and governance, it would be clear to regconize issues and insights better to design holistic solutions.
