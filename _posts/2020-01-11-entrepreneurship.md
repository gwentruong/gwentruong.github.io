Believe or not. I might not do that unless I manage to find lucrative problems to dig in.

There is no right answer when it comes to entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship to me is when you decide to be in charge of who you are, what you do and how you would become.

It is easy to have an idea. It is good to work on the idea to make it become reality. However, how long can you sustain on it?

Participating in many school and side projects, challenges and events gives you a good feeling of how things should be done without risking too much. In addition to that, it gives you more opportunities to expand new networks which introduce you to to endless of potential business ideas.

There are a lot of valuable resources available which are waiting to be fully utilized. The right attitude should be aware listening and learning.

Therefore, these are the skills that I think they would be beneficial.

- Self-management
- Networking
- Financial management
- Leadership
- Public speaking
