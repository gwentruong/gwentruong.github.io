Well, it is true that I can't achieve all at once and there should be a balance among them.

Sorry, the real title is ...

# To become a competent software developer

Most of my software development knowledge and skills were gained mostly from workplace, largely from self-learning and a little from some rushing computer science courses at the end of my bachelor degree.

Many online courses and bootcamps said that you need to learn this `<language>`, that `<language>`, know how to solve these interview questions in order to score a programming job. I would argue that it is not entirely true. While it is important to master at least one programming language which is relevant to the job, having the strong foundation of computer science knowledge, an overview of current technologies and problem solving skills enables you to learn almost any programming language easier and solve problems more efficiently.

Entering the field opened many doors to get a hand on different technologies. My work is really exciting as I have been having the chance to take the lead in programming and designing many parts of database system by myself and receiving so many helpful guidance from colleagues. You realise the software developing industry requires similar or even more working skills comparing other workplace in terms of collaboration and communication.

So back to the title of this post:

**What does it take to become a competent software developer?**

## In short:

- Good foundation of computer science knowledge (architecture, algorithm, security, etc).
- Understanding and keeping track of current available technologies.
- Ability to learn fast and attitude toward learning and deepening knowledge.
- Good communication and collaboration skills.
- Valuing your own strength and knowing your limit.
- Improving knowledge of your industry and your users.
- Sharp and excellent researching skills.
- Practicing everyday.

The GIS track which I am pursuing requires knowledge and skills of the whole ecosystem both in software development and data science. Most of skills and knowledge mentioned would be acquired during work and self-learning. Skills set for data science side is mentioned in another post.
