Sweat, blood, tears...?

Your dream product isn't that valuable if no one wants or needs it. And you don't want to give in to producing products which feed into toxic consumerism. Let's keep our core value tight and thought about the nature around us, alright?

Aalto University does offer a unique learning experience by giving money to students to build a prototype for a new product, which collaborates with many businesses from different industries. The course is called [Product Development Project](https://pdp.fi) from [Design Factory](https://designfactory.aalto.fi/).

I feel very fortunate to be in this [project](https://pdp.fi/2019/10/team-wonder/) for school year 2019-2020. Eventually, I utilised many of the techniques from this course on many other side projects. One of the most current notably projects is [Baltic Connect](https://gwentruong.github.io/balticconnect) which won the [WeSeaChallenge](https://turkubusinessregion.com/2019/12/05/ideoita-itameren-tilan-parantamiseksi/?fbclid=IwAR0WLihW7sk65_leTbI_8ndaf5lXpT9EJ6Yb1yw1S2esn8IvxUjABx81YqU) hosted by Turku Science Park Oy. The team even decided to navigate the market more thoroughly to develop the our idea and product further.

> Nice bragging, so let's go back to the main question, shall we?

**What have I learned and contemplated so far about product development:**

1. Market research and competitors research

A lot of reading, googling, interviews, analyzing market and trends, dissecting available competitors' products and analyzing their strength and weaknesses. Some can be done through interviewing right people, etc. All of these are done to answer to question:

**IS THIS WORTH PURSUING?**

2. Users research

One of the most important tasks. Nothing can go wrong with going extra miles to find who are your primary users, secondary and tertiary ones and what do they need.

Needs a lot of interviews. Needs a lot of site visits. Needs a lot of follow up and feedback from users.

**WHAT DO YOU WANT? DOES THIS SATISFY YOU?**

3. Ideas generating

This should be done in early phase of product development. We just need to generate a lot of ideas, regardless of the level of craziness and authenticity.

**THERE IS NO STUPID IDEA, PERIOD**

4. Evaluation on current technologies and assessment on your skill sets and resources

> The customers want a shipment service from the Mars to the Earth and vice versa without involving any rocket. It should be done monthly.

Okay...

**ARE WE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THIS?**

5. Prototyping, feedbacks and repeat (xN)

**ITERATION AND EVALUATION**

6. Pitching and selling

This is not just the job of commissioned sale guy. We owns the product, we need to communicate the real value of it to other stakeholders and users.

**IN THE END, IT IS ABOUT SELLING...**

7. Project management

Timeline, resources, finance, ideas, schedule, team management, etc

**IT IS IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE WELL WITH YOUR TEAM**
